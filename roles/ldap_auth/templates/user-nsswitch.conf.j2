#
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# An example Name Service Switch config file. This file should be
# sorted with the most-used services at the beginning.
#
# The entry '[NOTFOUND=return]' means that the search for an
# entry should stop if the search in the previous entry turned
# up nothing. Note that if the search failed due to some other reason
# (like no NIS server responding) then the search continues with the
# next entry.
#
# Valid entries include:
#
#	nisplus			Use NIS+ (NIS version 3)
#	nis			Use NIS (NIS version 2), also called YP
#	dns			Use DNS (Domain Name Service)
#	files			Use the local files in /etc
#	db			Use the pre-processed /var/db files
#	compat			Use /etc files plus *_compat pseudo-databases
#	hesiod			Use Hesiod (DNS) for user lookups
#	sss			Use sssd (System Security Services Daemon)
#	[NOTFOUND=return]	Stop searching if not found so far
#
# 'sssd' performs its own 'files'-based caching, so it should
# generally come before 'files'.

# To use 'db', install the nss_db package, and put the 'db' in front
# of 'files' for entries you want to be looked up first in the
# databases, like this:
#
# passwd:    db files
# shadow:    db files
# group:     db files
